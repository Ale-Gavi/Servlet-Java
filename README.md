# Project Name: Servlet-based Web Application

## Introduction

This project is a Java-based web application built using **Jakarta EE 8** and deployed on a **Tomcat 9.1** server. It follows a **Servlet** architecture, which is a fundamental component of Java web development. The application has been developed using **IntelliJ IDEA** as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE), offering a robust and efficient development experience.

### Technologies Used:

* **Java 8** (or newer)
* **Jakarta EE 8** for web application development
* **Servlet API** for handling HTTP requests and responses
* **Apache Tomcat 9.1** as the web server
* **IntelliJ IDEA** as the IDE

This servlet application provides a foundation for building dynamic, server-side web applications with Java, focusing on handling HTTP requests and managing sessions.

### Features:

* Servlet-based architecture for handling web requests.
* Easy integration with the Tomcat 9.1 server for deployment.
* Built with Jakarta EE 8, enabling features such as dependency injection, session management, and more.

This project demonstrates how to create a simple, yet scalable web application using the Servlet API and Jakarta EE, perfect for learning or as a base for more complex web solutions.
